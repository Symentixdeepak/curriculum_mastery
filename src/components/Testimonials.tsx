                &ldquo;Pratik is no ordinary music educator. He is a musician at heart first and his main focus, as an educator, is to install this belief in his students&apos; mind. An accomplished and an experienced live musician, who also happens to be a highly qualified individual. Imbibing all these elements together is a very rare quality in today&apos;s time. A mix of traditional and modern approach is exactly what he does and believes in. I&apos;ve shared the stage with him for over a decade and along with that, he has been an absolute rockstar as a presenter at Trinity College London - India.&rdquo;
