Testimonials
Pratik Kulgod is an exceptional educator and leader. As his HoD at SIS Mumbai, I witnessed his diligence, proactive approach, and collegial nature. He consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and dedication to music education. His leadership qualities and passion for music made his eventual promotion to subject head of music well-deserved and unsurprising.

Pratik is no ordinary music educator. He is a musician at heart first and his main focus, as an educator, is to install this belief in his students’ mind. An accomplished and an experienced live musician, who also happens to be a highly qualified individual. Imbibing all these elements together is a very rare quality in today's time. A mix of traditional and modern approach is exactly what he does and believes in. I've shared the stage with him for over a decade and along with that, he has been an absolute rockstar as a presenter at Trinity College London - India.

FAQs
Q: Is this course right for me?
If you wish to teach music as an academic subject in the IB and/or IGCSE school curriculum, then yes. While most schools currently do not require a specific degree for this role, they typically hire based on prior teaching experience, proficiency in at least one instrument, and the ability to manage the complex curriculum. 
The subject scores or grades affect a student’s overall average and their chances of being admitted to their desired universities abroad.


Q: What makes this course unique - what can I learn here that I cannot find elsewhere or figure out on my own?
In this course, we teach you both IGCSE + IBDP Music curricula for a much smaller fee compared to your other options. 
In other available courses, you pay Rs 33,000 for IGCSE Music (Introduction + Assessment Workshop) and Rs 1,20,000 for IB DP Music (Category 1 + Category 2 + Category 3 Workshops).
We created this course based on my years of experience, insights gained from excellent mentors, and extensive involvement in instrument training, academic teaching, grading, and coordinating a music department - from setting up the music room to supporting students’ bands, performances, and portfolios. 


Q: What should I do if I miss a class?
It’s only 3 hours split over 4 days spread across 4 weeks. Consider it a taste of school teaching life, which requires a level of consistency and discipline - perhaps a test of your seriousness in pursuing a career as a music educator. This is a short commitment compared to the actual work you will be prepared for after completing this course.


Q: Would this enable me to get a job at an IB or IGCSE school?
This course is a hands-on teacher training module designed to empower you to confidently manage the diverse responsibilities that come with the role. You will also become part of a supportive community where you can seek guidance if you encounter challenges or simply reach out to us via email.
