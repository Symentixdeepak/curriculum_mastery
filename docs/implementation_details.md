# Implementation Details

## Summary of Changes
- Simplified the Hero section in `src/app/page.tsx`: removed floating music symbols and animated SVG wave background; replaced with a clean, subtle card-style hero using brand styling.
- Replaced inline Testimonial and FAQ blocks in `src/app/page.tsx` with reusable components:
  - `<Testimonials />` from `src/components/Testimonials.tsx`
  - `<FAQ />` from `src/components/FAQ.tsx`
- Inserted `<ContactUs />` (from `src/components/ContactUs.tsx`) before the Disclaimer section.
- Removed unused `openFaq` state from `src/app/page.tsx` (FAQ state is managed inside the component), fixing lint warnings and an undefined `toggleFaq` reference.
- Constrained About section text width to two-thirds on large screens (`w-full lg:w-2/3`) in `src/app/page.tsx` for improved readability.

## Files Touched
- `src/app/page.tsx`: structure updates and cleanup.
- No changes to `src/components/FAQ.tsx`, `src/components/Testimonials.tsx`, `src/components/ContactUs.tsx`, but they are now central to the IA.
- `src/styles/brand-colors.css` was referenced for gradient and color utilities.

## Content Sources
- `docs/Website Content Working Document.txt`
- `public/website content/Website Content WIP.txt`
- Assets in `public/assets/` and `public/website content/`

## Behavior Notes
- Newsletter remains in the page and posts to `/api/newsletter`.
- Hero now renders without heavy animations to improve clarity and performance.
- Navigation anchors: `#modules`, `#contact` are present.
- CTA buttons link to `/register` and `/course`.

## Rationale
- Using components reduces duplication, prevents bugs (undefined `toggleFaq`), and improves maintainability.
- Keeping newsletter and existing routes preserves backward compatibility.

## Testing Checklist
- Verify page renders without console errors.
- Test FAQ expand/collapse.
- Test “Enroll Now” and “View Details” links.
- Test Contact form mailto behavior.
- Verify responsive behavior across breakpoints.
