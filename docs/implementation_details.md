# Implementation Details

## Summary of Changes
- Simplified the Hero section in `src/app/page.tsx`: removed floating music symbols and animated SVG wave background; replaced with a clean, subtle card-style hero using brand styling.
- Replaced inline Testimonial and FAQ blocks in `src/app/page.tsx` with reusable components:
  - `<Testimonials />` from `src/components/Testimonials.tsx`
  - `<FAQ />` from `src/components/FAQ.tsx`
- Inserted `<ContactUs />` (from `src/components/ContactUs.tsx`) before the Disclaimer section.
- Removed unused `openFaq` state from `src/app/page.tsx` (FAQ state is managed inside the component), fixing lint warnings and an undefined `toggleFaq` reference.
- Constrained About section text width to two-thirds on large screens (`w-full lg:w-2/3`) in `src/app/page.tsx` for improved readability.
- **Updated email addresses**: Changed from `pratik@currciculum-mastery.in` to `hello@curriculum-mastery.in` (also fixed typo "currciculum" → "curriculum") in `src/components/ContactUs.tsx`.
- **Fixed text formatting consistency**: Applied uniform `text-lg leading-relaxed` classes to all paragraphs in the About Pratik Kulgod section for consistent text size and line spacing.
- **Updated Requirements section color scheme**: Changed from red/orange theme to light blue theme using `border-blue-100`, `from-blue-50 to-sky-50` gradient, `bg-blue-100` backgrounds, `text-blue-600` icons, and `text-blue-800` warning text.
- **Updated Resources section color scheme**: Changed from green theme to match Requirements section light blue theme using `border-blue-100`, `from-blue-50 to-sky-50` gradient, and `bg-blue-100` icon backgrounds for visual consistency.
- **Header branding updates**: Removed "by Pratik Kulgod" subtitle, increased logo size by 1.5x (`h-[108px] sm:h-[144px]`), made text with balanced width sizing ("Curriculum" at `text-xl sm:text-3xl` with `tracking-wide`, "MASTERY" at `text-2xl sm:text-4xl`) displayed on two lines with mixed case styling ("Curriculum" in title case, "MASTERY" in all caps), and moved significantly closer to logo (`gap-3` → `gap-1.5` → `gap-1` for 67% total reduction).
- **Hero section updates**: Removed "View Details" button, changed "Enroll Now - ₹49,900" to "Learn More" button that scrolls to the "What You'll Learn" section (#what-youll-learn) for better user journey flow.
- **Restructured hero section**: Full-width hero with responsive vertical video:
  - Hero section: Full width (`max-w-6xl`) with responsive layout (`flex-col lg:flex-row`)
  - Desktop: Video positioned to the right of hero content (w-64, hidden lg:block)
  - Mobile: Video positioned below Learn More button (lg:hidden, max-w-xs mx-auto)
  - Removed: Course Overview section and logo watermark background
  - Two-column layout: Starts after hero section with main content left, enrollment banner right
- **YouTube video integration**: Replaced video placeholders with actual YouTube embed:
  - Video URL: `https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m4kdTUWkblA` converted to embed format
  - Responsive iframe implementation with `aspect-[9/16]` ratio for vertical video format
  - Full accessibility attributes including title, allowFullScreen, and proper iframe permissions
  - Consistent styling with rounded corners and proper positioning for both mobile and desktop views
- **Complete color scheme redesign**: Replaced all gradients with solid colors using new hex palette:
  - Dark Blue (#0a2b56): Primary brand color for buttons, text highlights, and main elements
  - Gray (#d7d4d4): Border colors and neutral backgrounds
  - Gray Blue (#8b8c9b): Icon backgrounds and accent elements
  - Cobalt Blue (#004aad): Secondary brand color for alternate elements
  - Light Gray (#f7f6f7): Main background color and card backgrounds
  - Removed all CSS gradients and replaced with solid color implementations
  - Updated brand-colors.css with new color variables and mappings
  - Applied consistent color scheme across all components (Header, StickyEnrollBanner, page sections)
- **Simplified hero content**: Removed Course Overview details, kept core messaging and Learn More button
- **Updated enrollment banner**: `StickyEnrollBanner.tsx` positioned in dedicated right sidebar column with sticky positioning
- **Mobile enrollment banner**: Added enrollment banner above footer for mobile/tablet views (`xl:hidden`) using same `StickyEnrollBanner` component with consistent styling and spacing

## Files Touched
- `src/app/page.tsx`: structure updates, cleanup, About section text formatting consistency, hero button removal, sticky banner integration, mobile enrollment banner placement, and complete color scheme redesign.
- `src/components/ContactUs.tsx`: email address updates and typo fixes.
- `src/components/Header.tsx`: logo sizing, branding text updates, subtitle removal, and gradient-to-solid color conversion.
- `src/components/StickyEnrollBanner.tsx`: enrollment banner component for right sidebar column, mobile placement, and color scheme updates.
- `src/styles/brand-colors.css`: complete overhaul with new hex color palette and removal of gradient variables.
- No changes to `src/components/FAQ.tsx`, `src/components/Testimonials.tsx`, but they are now central to the IA.

## Content Sources
- `docs/Website Content Working Document.txt`
- `public/website content/Website Content WIP.txt`
- Assets in `public/assets/` and `public/website content/`

## Behavior Notes
- Newsletter remains in the page and posts to `/api/newsletter`.
- Hero now renders without heavy animations to improve clarity and performance.
- Navigation anchors: `#modules`, `#contact` are present.
- CTA buttons link to `/register` and `/course`.

## Rationale
- Using components reduces duplication, prevents bugs (undefined `toggleFaq`), and improves maintainability.
- Keeping newsletter and existing routes preserves backward compatibility.

## Testing Checklist
- Verify page renders without console errors.
- Test FAQ expand/collapse.
- Test “Enroll Now” and “View Details” links.
- Test Contact form mailto behavior.
- Verify responsive behavior across breakpoints.
